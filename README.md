# Common Expression Language - Go Toolchain

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/google/cel-go.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/google/cel-go) [![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/google/cel-go)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/google/cel-go)

This repo contains the Go toolchain for the Common Expression Language (CEL).
CEL is a non-Turing complete language designed to be portable and fast. It is
best suited to  applications where sandboxing a full-fledged language like
JavaScript or Lua would be too resource intensive, but side-effect free dynamic
computations are strongly desired.

## Want to learn more?

* See the [CEL Spec][1] for more details about the language.
* Ask for support on the [CEL Go Discuss][2] Google group.

## Want to integrate CEL?

* See [GoDoc][6] to learn how to integrate CEL into services written in Go.
  [![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/google/cel-go?status.svg)][6]
* See the [CEL C++][3] toolchain (under development) for information about how
  to integrate CEL evaluation into other environments.

## Want to contribute?

* See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.
* Use [GitHub Issues][4] to request features or report bugs.

## How does CEL work?

Write an expression in the CEL syntax, then parse, check, and interpret.

| Step      | Description                                                    |
|-----------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Parse     | Parses a string expression to a protocol buffer representation.|
| Check     | Type-checks a parsed expression against a given environment.   |
| Interpret | Evaluates parsed expressions against a set of inputs.          |      |

Type-checking an expression in an optional, but strongly encouraged step that
can be used to reject some expressions as semantically invalid using static
analysis. Additionally, the type-check produces some additional metadata
related to function overload resolution and object field selection which may
be used by the interpret step to speed up execution.

### Example

The following example shows the parse, check, and intepretation of a simple
program. After the parse and type-check steps, the service checks whether there
are any errors that need to be reported.

```go
import(
	"fmt"
	"log"

	"github.com/google/cel-go/cel",
	"github.com/google/cel-go/checker/decls"
)

func main() {
	// Variables used within this expression environment.
	decls := cel.Declarations(
		decls.NewIdent("i", decls.String, nil),
		decls.NewIdent("you", decls.String, nil))
	env, err := cel.NewEnv(decls)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("environment creation error: %s\n", err)
	}

	// Parse and type-check the expression.
	//
	// Detailed information about which issues/errors were encountered may be
	// found within the `iss`, but a non-nil `iss.Err()` value will contain a
	// detailed error string in human-readable form.
	p, iss := env.Parse(`"Hello " + you + "! I'm " + i + "."`)
	if iss != nil && iss.Err() != nil {
		log.Fatalln(iss.Err())
	}
	c, iss := env.Check(p)
	if iss != nil && iss.Err() != nil {
		log.Fatalln(iss.Err())
	}

	// Create the program, and evaluate it against some input.
	prg, err := env.Program(c)
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("program creation error: %s\n", err)
	}

	// Note, the second result, the EvalDetails will be non-nil when using
	// either cel.OptTrackState or cel.OptExhaustiveEval (not shown). The
	// details value holds information about the evaluation, rather than the
	// output of the evaluation itself.
	out, _, err := prg.Eval(cel.Vars(map[string]interface{}{
		"i": "CEL",
		"you": "world"}))
	if err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("runtime error: %s\n", err)
	}

	// Hello world! I'm CEL.
	fmt.Println(out)
}
```

More examples like these can be found within the unit tests which can be run
using [Bazel][5]:
